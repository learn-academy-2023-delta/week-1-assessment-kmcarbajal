# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Researched answer: The driver will share their screen, hands on keyboard. The navigator will talk through the coding process. Switch roles every 10-25 minutes. The driver uses the keyboard, mouse and manages the editor. The navigator watches, advises, thinking and responsible for higher-level input to the code and catching errors.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: "A higher-order function is a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes higher-order functions incredible useful for iteration." (syllabus)

2. Jest: "Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase." (syllabus)

3. Objects: "Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior." (syllabus)

4. Method: Method is an object property that has a function value. (google)

5. Classes: A type of function that has data and behavior used as templates for creating objects. (syllabus)
